# Understanding Trust and Confidence in Law Enforcement: A Data Science Approach
### Project Context
Law enforcement agencies, including the Metropolitan Police Service in London, are increasingly focusing on building trust and confidence among communities. This project uses data science methods to understand what influences trust and confidence in the Metropolitan Police. By analyzing data from the Public Attitude Survey (PAS) and crime statistics, the project aims to provide understanding and actionable insights for key decision-makers and operational officers within the timeframe of ~8 weeks.

### Objectives  ${\color{red}\text{Update later}}$
The broad nature of the problem statement The subquestions we aim to address as part of our approach to the project are as follows:
- [Subquestion 1]
- [Subquestion 2]

### Data Sources  
The project utilizes two primary datasets: the Public Attitude Survey and a comprehensive crime dataset sourced from https://data.police.uk/. The crime dataset spans all police-reported crimes in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland since December 2010, totaling over 70 million cases. Each reported crime is categorized by type (e.g., violent crime, burglary) and includes spatiotemporal details. To protect individual privacy, the data are aggregated monthly and geographically to Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs), provided by the Ordnance Survey for census-related purposes. Currently, there are 32,844 LSOAs in England.
